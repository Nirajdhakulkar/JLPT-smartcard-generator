# JLPT-smartcard-generator
JLPT Flashcard Generator is a Streamlit-based web application designed to help Japanese language learners prepare for JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) levels by generating quick and interactive flashcards.
Users can enter any Japanese word, and the app fetches the following details in real-time:

The app uses the Jisho.org API to retrieve word data and converts readings to Romaji using the pykakasi library. It's a lightweight, fast, and visually engaging tool ideal for N5â€“N3 JLPT learners or casual Japanese language enthusiasts.
